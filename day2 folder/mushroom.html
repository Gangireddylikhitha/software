About This Mushroom Masala
My mushroom masala recipe like most of my recipes is easy to prepare. To make this tasty curry, there is some prep work like making onion paste and tomato puree.

Both of which can be easily done in a good blender or mixer-grinder. When you are ready with the onion paste and tomato puree, making the mushroom masala is a breeze.


The onion paste is caramelized and this gives a deeper, richer flavor in the gravy. I also add fresh curd (yogurt) which makes the gravy a bit creamy with a smooth consistency and a flavorful taste.

There are no nuts like cashews and almonds in this mushroom masala gravy. Thus the curry does not have a thick and creamy consistency.

Instead it is incredibly flavorful, light with a gravy that can be easily poured on steamed rice. You can also have it with some soft dinner rolls or roti or paratha.

Most often I use this mushroom masala gravy base with slight modifications to make vegetable or paneer bhuna masala.

For a protein rich curry, you can also check this Soya Chunks Curry that I make on occasions.

Step-by-Step Guide
How to make Mushroom Masala
Preparation
1. Rinse or wipe dry 200 to 250 grams mushrooms. Slice off a bit of the base stalk. Then slice or chop them. Keep aside.

5. In the same jar, add ½ cup tightly packed chopped tomatoes.

6. Make a smooth puree without adding water. No need to blanch tomatoes before pureeing. Set the tomato puree aside. If using packaged puree, then add ⅓ cup tomato puree.

8. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a pan and add the following whole spices – ½ tsp cumin seeds, 2 small or 1 medium to large tej patta, ½ inch cinnamon, 1 black cardamom, 2 green cardamoms, 3 cloves and 1 single strand of mace.

I forgot to add tej patta at this step, so added later at step 11.

TIP: Black cardamom does give some smokiness to the dish, but can be omitted if you do not have it.

16. Stirring often sauté until you see oil releasing from the sides of the onion-tomato masala. The masala paste will also thicken and become glossy.

17. Add the sliced or chopped white button mushrooms.

18. Lower the heat and add the beaten curd (yogurt). Beat the curd separately in a bowl and then add. If you add curd without whisking, it can curdle or become grainy.

Add yogurt made from whole milk. Do not add low-fat milk or toned milk yogurt as they will split in the gravy.

If you do not have curd, then simply skip it.

21. Then add ¾ cup water or as required. You can add less or more water depending on the consistency you prefer.

Remember that mushrooms release water – so add less water keeping this point in mind. You can always add more water later if the gravy becomes very thick.

Hi Dassana,

Thanks for posting this delicious looking recipe. I’m going to try it very soon. Was just wondering if I can add babycorn to this dish. If yes, at what point do I add babycorn to the curry and will I need to cook it in advance before adding to the curry?
Thanks again.

Dassana Amit
Welcome and thanks. You can add baby corn to the dish. Baby corn and mushrooms can be added together. No need to cook it earlier. Baby corn will get cooked with the mushrooms.
